As a software developer, it is crucial to have a way to keep your code together or even a backup, and today we will be talking about GitHub, what it is, and when to use it.

Good to have

* A basic understanding of [git](https://git-scm.com/about).
    
* A GitHub account. If you do not have one, you can simply signup here [https://github.com](https://github.com)
    

### So, what is it?

> GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories based on a distributed version control system. It's an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer/server. Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based.

Before we dive in, let's clear up a common misconception: Git isn't the same thing as GitHub.

**Git** is a version-control system (i.e., a piece of software) that helps you keep track of your computer programs and files and the changes that are made to them over time. It also allows you to collaborate with your peers on a program, code, or file.

while

**GitHub** and similar services (including GitLab and BitBucket) are websites that host a Git server program to hold your code.
