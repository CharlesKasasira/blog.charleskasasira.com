### Brainstorming Phase

  
It's that time, the final year project. These are the ideas that come to my head at weird times. During talks with friends, movie, shower, commuting to and from college.

1. Develop an app that uses computer vision to identify plants and provide information on their care and maintenance.
    
2. Design a system that uses machine learning to detect anomalies in financial transactions and flag potential cases of fraud or money laundering.
    
3. Develop a software tool that analyzes and optimizes energy usage in buildings, recommending changes to reduce energy waste and costs.
    
4. Create a chatbot that uses natural language processing to provide mental health support, resources, and referrals for people experiencing anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues.
    
5. Create a language learning app that uses gamification and interactive lessons to help users improve their language skills.
    
6. An app that connects remote health care clinics in Uganda with central hospitals (Telemedicine).
    
7. Design an app that monitors and optimizes the usage of solar panels and other renewable energy sources.
    
8. E-learning platform for vocational Schools.
    
9. An app that provides information about local attractions to tourists. (Local Tourism Guide).
